Experiment main page for testing Scale-Invariant CNN architectures. 
Explores approaches utilizing both conventional CNNs, and Group-CNNs which utilize group theory principles to create equivariant convolutional layers via transformations of the input.

# About
This code details an empirical study involving the use of scale-equivariant neural networks on various real-life datasets, and has been produced as part of my Final Year Project with the University of Nottingham.
